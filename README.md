## Project Overview
The **Adventure Works Sales Analysis Dashboard** is an **Excel-based business analytics project** designed to analyze **sales performance, profitability, and customer transaction patterns**.

The dashboard transforms raw sales data into **actionable business insights** using Excel formulas, pivot tables, charts, and slicers. It provides both high-level and detailed views of revenue, profit, product performance, and time-based trends.

This is a **descriptive analytics** project focused on understanding historical business performance.

## Business Problem
Business stakeholders often struggle to:
- Track revenue and profit performance efficiently  
- Identify top-performing products  
- Understand sales trends over time  
- Compare weekday vs weekend sales behavior

Raw Excel data alone does not make these insights immediately visible.

This project solves that problem by presenting key metrics in a **single interactive Excel dashboard**.

## Objectives
- Analyze overall sales, profit, and cost performance  
- Identify top-selling and most profitable products  
- Track monthly and yearly sales trends  
- Compare weekday vs weekend sales contribution  
- Enable interactive filtering by time and country
